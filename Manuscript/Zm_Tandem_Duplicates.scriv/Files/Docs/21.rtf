\f0\fs28 \cf0 The major questions we aim to address in this study are 1) How many genes are tandemly duplicated in the B73 and PH207 reference genomes, and where do they occur? 2) How many tandem duplicate genes show evidence of functional divergence, at the DNA sequence or expression levels? 3) What is the age distribution of tandem duplications, and is there a relationship between their age and functional outcome? To answer these questions, we compared the B73 and PH207 reference genomes to the outgroup species 
\i Sorghum bicolor
\i0  using the CoGe suite of scripts to identify putative tandem duplicates. We then use RNAseq data from six tissues and PAML to compare functional and expression divergence of tandem duplicates. Finally, we estimate the ages of tandem duplicates, and compare those to their estimated functional outcomes.}
