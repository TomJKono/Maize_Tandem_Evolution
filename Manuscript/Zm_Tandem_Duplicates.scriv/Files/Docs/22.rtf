\f0\fs28 \cf0 Gene duplications provide a mechanism through which functional novelty may arise. Many protein coding genes in eukaryotes are part of large families of genes with related function, consistent with origins in gene duplication (Rubin et al. 2000). Duplicated genes may either be tandem (proximal to each other), or dispersed (separated in the genome). Dispersed duplicate genes may functionally diverge because the two copies may be subject to different regulatory pressures. Conversely, genes that are tandemly duplicated may have the same regulatory elements, and thus may not diverge in the same way as dispersed duplicates. }
