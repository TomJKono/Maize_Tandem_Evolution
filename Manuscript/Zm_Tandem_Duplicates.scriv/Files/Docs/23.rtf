\f0\fs28 \cf0 Recent improvements in DNA sequencing technology allow for the resolution of duplicated sequences. Reads are now long enough to span repetitive elements, where shorter reads would either miss or collapse repetitive sequences. In maize, the latest B73 reference genome was assembled with long read sequencing, which allows for improved resolution of repetitive sequences than previous assemblies. Additionally, a 
\i de noco
\i0  genome assembly of PH207, another maize inbred line, has become recently available. While the PH207 assembly was generated with short read sequencing, it provides an opportunity to examine the nature of gene duplication and loss in maize. \
