\f0\fs28 \cf0 Transposable element sequence similarity in tandem duplicate genes was assessed with nucleotide BLAST searches. Full-length transposable element sequences were generated from the B73 and PH207 reference sequences using the transposable element structural annotations from each reference. These were then converted into BLAST databases, and each tandem duplicate gene was used as a query to search the database for similar sequences. Matches to transposable element sequences were accepted if they matched at least 50% of the gene sequence with an E-value threshold of 1e-10. A single gene sequence may have matches to multiple transposable elements, due to the nested nature of some transposable element insertions. Genome wide transposable element similarities were estimated by BLAST searches of all genes against the transposable element database.}
