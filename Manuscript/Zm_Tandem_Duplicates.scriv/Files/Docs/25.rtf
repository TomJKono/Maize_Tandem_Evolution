\f0\fs28 \cf0 When a gene duplicates, it potentially generates a phenotypic impact through alteration of gene product dosage. In many cases, the sudden change of gene product concentration has deleterious  effects on the physiology of the organism, and will be selected against. In some cases, however, the increased gene expression may be beneficial, and there will be selection to maintain the duplication, e.g., tandem duplications conferring soybean cyst nematode resistance at 
\i Rhg1
\i0  (Cook et al. 2012).\
In the long run, the fate of tandem duplicate genes is less straightforward the binary of retained as a beneficial allele, or lost as a deleterious variant. Mutations in the regulatory regions of tandem duplicates, or mutations in the coding sequence, may cause the genes to be expressed in different tissues, or may cause the genes to fulfill non-redundant functional roles. Several models such as the \'93duplication-degeneration-complementation\'94 model or the \'93escape from adaptive conflict\'94 model describe these scenarios as possible outcomes of tandem duplicates (Innan 2009). }
