Clustal Omega was run with a maximum of 10 iterations and with the full distance matrix used for each clustering iteration. Alignments were then backtranslated to nucleotides to compute synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates. Substitution rates were estimated with the \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91polydNdS\u8217\'92 program from the \u8216\'91analysis\u8217\'92 package (GitHub link).}}
